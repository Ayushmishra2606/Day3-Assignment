    <h2>Reviews</h2>


    <h3>Imdb</h3>
    <p>This film is a complete assault on your senses, mixing insane action sequences, quirky dialogues, and a plot so
        over-the-top, it borders on the absurd</p>

    <h3>Himesh Reshammiya</h3>
    <p>"Badass Ravi Kumar has a fast pace and keeps the viewer hooked to the screen with a regular dose of smiles and
        joy scattered through its 142 mins."</p>
